✅Tarzik validator

Hi, I'm an individual validator.

A fan of Web3 and blockchain networks. My experience in validation is more than a year. I have participated in more tests.

I am very responsible to the nodes, smooth operation of the node is the most important for me, I monitor with (Grafana + Prometeus + Discord alerts + TenderDuty)

A good validator should have 100% uptime
